!!Barak Varr

Barak Varr, or 'the Gate of the Sea' is unique amongst the Dwarf stronghols. The powerful tides of the Black Gulf have carved out a deep cave system into the tall white rock, and here in these vast sea caverns the Dwarfs harbour their trading fleet.

The Holdof Barak Varr is small in comparison to the strongholds that tunnel deep into the Worlds Edge Mountains, but the Dwarfs of the Hold enjoy a relatively cosmopolitan lifestyle, and are less dour and introverted than other Dwarfs.

!!Karak Azgal

Karak Azgal was once an extremely wealthy Dwarf Hold that has since fallen under the control of the Greenskins and the Skaven. The Greenskins destroyed and abandoned Karak Azgal in frustration after failing to find Stunty treasure. The Dragon Graug the Terrible soon claimed the hold. For many years, treasure seekers and adventurers came to the crag to challenge the Dragon and loot the ruins. All of them failed until the Dwarf warrior Skalf Dragonslayer entered the ruins. He discovered the hidden vault and confronted Graug. After an epic battle, Skalf slew the Dragon by chopping off his head, claimed the treasures and the kingship of Karak Azgal for himself. The Dwarfs made no attempt to recapture the hold, which is still infested with Goblins, Skaven, and other foul creatures. Instead, Skalf and his descendants established a town, Deadgate, in the valley below the old entrance.

It is now a major destination for adventuring and mercenary bands of the Old World who seek to brave its dangers in the hopes of plundering its still vast riches. The Dwarfs are happy to allow this activity — so long as they can heavily tax any who return to the surface after plundering their former home.

!!Karak Azul

The last of the great southern holds to remain under Dwarf control, Karak Azul, is situated over the richest iron mines in the Worlds Edge Mountains. It has withstood its long history of invasions thanks to the determination and skill of its weaponsmiths and armourers. The keenest blades and the most impenetrable suits of armour come from the anvils of Karak Azul. There, the finest Runesmiths, watched over by Thorek Ironbrow, toil to forge weapons to arm the beleaguered outposts found throughout the Karaz Ankor.

!!Karak Eight Peaks

Karak Eight Peaks was one of the greatest kingdoms ever created by the Dwarfs of the Golden Age, rivaling even the capital city of Karaz-a-Karak in terms of sheer power, wealth, and beauty. As the cataclysmic age known as the Time of Woes has erupted all across the world, the grand halls of Karak Eight Peaks were laid low by coming onslaught of the Greenskin and Skaven race. With their arrival, the city has become an eternal battleground between these three races that would endure until the inevitable destruction of this world.

Recently Belegar Ironhammer and his dwarves have gained a foothold in the city, largely confined to the surface and upper levels of the city, despite being under a near-continuous siege. Slowly they found and sealed off the tunnels the goblins and Skaven had used to breach the city, as well as walling off areas too poisoned by Chaos to be reclaimed.

!!Karak Kadrin

Situated south of Peak Pass, Karak Kadrin (“Stronghold of the Pass”) is the largest of the northern holds after Karaz-a-Karak. In its heyday, the pass connected the strongholds of the west to the mines and settlements of the eastern side of the World's Edge Mountains. Since the fall of the east, Dwarfs no longer use this pass, but it has become one of the main routes for marauding Orcs and Goblins from the Dark Lands. Karak Kadrin, nicknamed “The Slayer Keep” by the Dwarfs, guards the pass against the greenskin invaders.

!!Zhufbar

Twin hold to Karak Varn, Zhufbar (Khazalid for "Torrent-gate") is the hold where the metals, Gromril in particular, mined out from beneath Karak Varn are smelted and forged into the weapons and armour which make the Dwarfs famous.

The most mechanized of strongholds, Zhufbar is built into a deep chasm worn over time from a torrential waterfall that cascades down through its centre. The sound of thousands of grinding water wheels, wheezing bellows and pounding drop hammers echoes off nearby peaks - a never-ceasing tumult of industry.

Created as an industrial centre, the hold also has the most important shrine for the Dwarf Engineers Guild and their Guildmaster sits on the Kings Council. Many types of machinery subsequently used throughout the dwarven empire were developed and tested at Zhufbar such as powerful pumps used to clear flooded mines.

!!Karak Angazhar

Karak Angazhar, known also as Karak Angazbar is a small Dwarf Kingdom in the Black Mountains located just west of Black Fire Pass. Part of the Realm is the Fortess Migdhal Vongalbavak which guards the eastern entrance of Black Fire Pass. Karaz Angazhar is ancient enough and close enough to the old holds of Karaz Ankor to be occasionally mistaken as a Karaz Ankor settlement.

They have both the toughness of the dwarfs living in Karaz Ankor and also the athletism of the western dwarfs. The dwarfs of Karak Angazhar realized their comparative advantage and specialized in training tough yet faster and more agile warriors, and for the football: Blitzers.

!!Karak Hirn

Karak Hirn, known as the "Hornhold" in Khazalid, is the most important Dwarf kingdom in the Black Mountains between Tilea and the southern borders of The Empire.

A young and growing kingdom with many vassal fiefdoms surrounding it, this hold was settled slowly, and only grew in relative importance after the near-collapse of the old Dwarf Empire. Some of the cities that make up this hold are built on the mountain's side, and a few are even exposed to the air. Due to its position in the Black Mountains, this hold is not connected to the Underway, and so must be approached via overground roads, therefor passing through treacherous mountain passes and cliff-hanging tracks. Rich deposits of precious metals and iron are found here, but there are only a few lodes of the more rare metals and gems. None of the strongholds and cities of Karak Hirn have become wealthy or powerful enough to rival the great kingdoms and empires of the Worlds Edge Mountains. However, it is closer and more accessible to the markets of the Empire and Tilea and acts as a trading centre and market for imported wares from the ancient holds in the Worlds Edge Mountains.

Karak Hirn is famous for its hissing, furnace-hearted beasts beloved of its Engineers.

!!Karak Izor

Karak Izor, known as the "Copper Hold" in Khazalid or "Copper Mountain" as humans call it, is considered the biggest and most important Dwarf kingdom in the south of the Old World, as a result of being built on a glacier-bound mountain that contains vast quantities of copper and other assorted minerals. The mountain the hold is built on is a part of a chain of mountains known as the Vaults.

The King of Karak Izor is intent on creating his own version of Karaz Ankor with the neighbouring settlements in the Vaults. How this will be received in Karaz-a-Karak is uncertain. Even though these Dwarfholds are nominally independent of Karaz Ankor, many of their inhabitants still look towards the High King for guidance and leadership. Other Dwarf Kings are waiting to see how the High King reacts to this potential threat on his authority. Should it go unchallenged, other Dwarf Kings may expand their dominions; doubtless some of them will justify their actions by the need to check Karak Izor's expansion. A firmer response has the potential to re-open the rift between these Dwarf realms and Karaz Ankor. The situation could even lead to civil war.

!!Karak Norn

Karak Norn is built amonst the Grey mountains. On one side of the hold lies the forest of Loren and on the otherside lies the Black Mountains and Bugmans Brewery.

The most famous claim of Karak Norn is being the Hold most associated with the great hero and brewmaster Josef Bugman. Josef's father Zamnil Bugman was one of the Dragonback Clan of Ekrund, and after it was overrun the family migrated northwest into the foot of the Grey Mountains on the Empire side near Karak Norn. Bugman's Brewery quickly became famous for their specialty of Troll Brew, and more importantly Bugman's XXXXX AKA Bugman's Brew which became world-famous as the greatest alcoholic beverage ever concocted. Unfortunately one day a Goblin named Git Guzzler attacked the Brewery while Bugman was away delivering ale. When Bugman returned to his ruined brewery, it appeared that most of the ale had been drunken in one victorious orgy of destruction. After the looting of Bugman's Brewery, Git Guzzler fled eastward into the Worlds Edge Mountains, and from thence his fate is unknown. The Brewery was rebuilt and is now defended by the forces of Karak Norn, and the hold is payed with ale.

The athletes of Karak Norn play for the fun of the game and they enjoy it the most with some ale in the belly.
