!!Altdorf

Altdorf is the largest and wealthiest city in the Empire and is home to the Imperial Court. It is a cosmopolitan city-state: not only do folk of all ranks, species, creeds, and backgrounds rub shoulders freely, but even wizards are a common sight, rarely receiving more hostility than a wary glance or  muttered blessing. There is a populous Elf quarter near the Reiksport. The old alliance between the Empire and Dwarfs has stood since Sigmar’s time and ensures many Dwarf clans also reside there in tight-knit communities. There is even a healthy Halfling population, with most earning their crusts serving fine food and better ales in Altdorf ’s hostelries, many of which are guarded by the city’s sizeable Ogre population.

The Cathedral of Sigmar is the chapter house of the Order of the Knights Griffon who are a knightly order founded by Magnus the Pious just following the Great War Against Chaos. They are tasked with protecting Temples of Sigmar, in particular the Holy Temple of Sigmar in Altdorf. The Knights Griffon are arguably the most drilled and militaristic Order in the modern Empire. Their daily rituals mostly consist of strict martial training. To the Knights Griffon, defeat is an unthinkable event, brought on solely by the actions or inactions of others. As a result, they are slow to flee a losing fight, and will never refuse a martial challenge.

!!Averland

Averland is an extremely wealthy province. Its borders include the dangerous Black Fire Pass, a common invasion route into the Empire. Lacking the great forests that cover much of the rest of the Empire, Averland is a series of sun-drenched rolling plains running roughly northwest to southeast between the rivers of the Upper Reik, the Aver, and the Blue Reach. Averland is neighbour to the Moot, the Halfling province and the Averlanders have gained a fruitful relationship with the Halfling realm, employing the diminitive but doughy warriors of their armies as scouts and archers.

A secular knightly order which makes its home in Averland is The Order of the Black Bear. The name of the Order comes from its mythical founder- a poor yet noble knight who wrestled a bear to rescue a lady. The myth is maintained and remembered in the tradition of the Grand Master wrestling a bear before every tournament. The Knights have have fashioned a series of martial tournaments to provide an outlet for their energies (they had previously engaged in the practice of Halfling coursing — outlawed in 2402). These tourneys test all facets of what the Black Bear perceive to be Knightly skills and include such feats as swordplay, horsemanship, and of course, quaffing.

!!Marienburg

The largest and wealthiest city in the Old World, Marienburg stands at the mouth of the River Reik. Marienburg seceded from the Empire in the year 2429 thanks to the vast bribes and the greed of Emperor Dieter IV. Marienburg is now ruled by Burgomeisters and powerful mercantile guilds.

Marienburg is home to what is one of the most unusual spots in the Old World: Sith Rionnasc'namishathir, the Elf Quarter, known formally as the Continental Exarchate of the High Kingdom of Ulthuan, called 'Elfsgemeente' by the Stadsraat and simply known as 'Elftown' by the locals.

Marienburg, for all the occasional noises from the Empire and the Cult of Sigmar about “reclaiming lost provinces,” has good if quiet relations with the Empire. The similar culture and shared history helps, as do the regular payments on the debts owed by several Electors, lower nobles, and free towns.

Despite Marienburg is the home city of the World Federation of !HammerBowl, the independent directorate almost left without anyone to play !HammerBowl with. Finally the wealth and lobbying power of the city of gold made it to be part of ''IMHABOC''. Yet this leverage was not enough to get a spot for the province of Wasteland too as it would hurt Empire people's pride.

!!Nuln

The city-state of Nuln trails only Altdorf in terms of size and population in the Empire. Famous for its ancient academies and its industry, Nuln is the home of vast forges and the Imperial Gunnery School. Though no longer the centre of the Empire, Nuln has managed to remain strong, as both a commercial and technological capital. One of the oldest human settlements in the Empire, Nuln has stood at the height of power and teetered on the brink of destruction. As a city, it is a place of contrasting architecture, a place of the decadently rich and desperately poor.

The Imperial Gunnery School is not only Nuln’s most famous attraction, but it’s also the most breathtaking example of Nuln’s innovative architectural skills. The School itself dominates the centre of the Universität, dwarfing the College of Engineering and the lesser institutions crowded in its shadows. The citizens are very proud of the school, celebrating the day of the school’s founding, and bragging to visitors of its excellence and importance to the Empire. Part of the reason for the loyalty to the school is because of the school’s efforts to care for orphans. Called “sons of the guns,” these unwanted children serve as workers and apprentices.

!!Reikland

Reikland is the most powerful and cosmopolitan province in the Empire. It has been the most important state of the Empire for nearly one hundred years, for it surrounds Altdorf, the current Imperial capital city, and its state armies are those under the command of the Emperor Karl Franz I himself.

Reikland is blessed with fertile farmland, vineyards, and dairy fields that produce a surplus of products for export. The mines of the Grey Mountains yield many valuable ores and stones, from iron and gold to marble and gems, whilst the Reikwald Forest, generally safer than woods in other parts of the Empire, yields valuable timber that supports a thriving boat-building industry.

Robust supporters of the military, many young Reikland nobles enter the army to make their names and fortune. Considered natural “officer material,” the chances of advancement are considerably better for those of Reikland birth, much to others’ disgust. Reiklanders almost always answer an Imperial call-to-arms in large numbers, and feel as if it is their duty to come to the aid of less-fortunate parts of the Empire.

!!Wissenland

The province of Wissenland is considered the Imperial armory of the Empire of Man, for it holds within its borders the city-state of Nuln, the largest industrial city within the Old World.

The farmlands of Wissenland are fertile near the Reik, but as the land rolls towards the mountains it becomes steadily more dry and stony. Chunks of bluish grey flint are so common that many nobles claim that the land is good for little but harvesting rocks. These stones are often seen heaped at the side of fields, or incorporated into local buildings. Many Wissenland children make their first pennies following the plough in spring, plucking the offending rocks from the lands. As a result, many become skilled at catching the odd crow or hare with a well-thrown flint.

At their best, Wissenlanders are stoic, dependable, and willing to endure hardship should it be needful. At their worst, they are depressing, dull, and obsessed with the gods.

!!Hochland

Hochland is a small but proud province, famed for its hunters and trackers. Fond of hunting in all its forms, tales of loyal friendship and jaunty ballads, Hochlanders are also known to be easily distracted by the prospect of a little sport.

Hochland’s main trade is in timber and woodcrafts. Thick woods of oak and sycamore grow in the south, while pine and cedar are in the north. Guilds of lumbermen cut down the trees, trim the trunks, and float the logs down-river to mills in Esk, Bergendorf, Krudenwald, and Hergig.

Hochland is most famous for its unique weapon, the Hochland long rifle. While this weapon is superior to most other firearms in the Empire, it is rare, and those who have them almost never sell them. For now, knowledge of their construction is limited to Hochland.

!!Laurelorn

Laurelorn Forest lies at the northern coastline of the Empire of Man, home to reclusive communities of Eonir. While both Middenland and Nordland claim the forest as theirs, the Elves dare either to try to enforce their claim. It lies west of Salzenmund and the Silver Hills above it, and stretches west to the borders with the Wasteland.

The Elves of Laurelorn are isolationist, wanting to be left alone in the beautiful woods they have come to call home. Unlike Men, who seek to tame the lands in which they live, the Elves of Laurelorn regard the forest and its land as a living thing, something they should live in harmony with, something over which they feel protective. The Wood Elves of Laurelorn know they are within the Empire, and it is with the Empire that they must deal. In their hearts and minds, during quiet moments of reflection, they know that they are a dying people and that they need the Empire and its teeming masses of Men for their protection. Acknowledging this unpleasant truth, some Wood Elves have decided to end their isolation and enter the Empire, just to make sure the Humans do not foul things up.

Although nowadays it's technically a part of the Nordland Count’s domain, the Laurelorn is in truth a wholly independent realm. By agreement with the Elector Counts of Nordland, the Elves allow Imperials to settle the area between the Rivers Salz and Demst, which enters the Sea of Claws at Hargendorf. Beyond the Demst is the core of Laurelorn, a place Nordlanders call “the Witch’s Wood” out of their superstitious fear of the Elf Queen. Imperials are forbidden to cross into it under pain of death: even the Elector Counts of Nordland are under this ban. What lies within the Witch’s Wood is unknown.

Thanks to the now closer relationship, the ''WFHB'' was able to convince the Elves of Laurelorn to take part in the league. It is considered a big win of sport diplomacy which could also be the beginning of a new era of the Human-Elven neighborhood.

There are no known towns.

!!Middenheim

Towering above the Drakwald forest is a sheer-sided pinnacle of white rock atop which sits the forest-city of Middenheim, the City of the White Wolf. The city-state of Middenheim is amongst the greatest and most fortified fortress-cities within the Old World and beyond.

The White Wolf is the sign of Ulric, the fierce warrior god of battle, winter and wolves. Ulric's domain is honour, bravery and prowess, and he has an intense hatred for cowardice and weakness. His followers are expected to be selfassured and independent, strong, fierce and honorable in all that they do. And so do the Middenheimers.

They are typically large, strongly built men with a well deserved reputation for ferocity. Many wear wolf pelts which custom decrees to be the mark of those who have slain a wolf with their own hands. These grim warriors are famously contemptuous of danger. They frequently go into battle bare-headed, scoffing at those who choose, for reasons of good sense, to wear helmets. As Middenheimers favour long hair and beards their lack of headgear makes them look especially fierce when they charge upon their enemies howling their brutal battle-cries. The men of Middenheim are famous for their physical prowess.

The city is the home of the Knights of the White Wolf, the most ancient and largest of the Templar Orders in the entire Old World. The Knights' wolf-skin cloaks, coupled with their long, often wild hair and beards, gives them a barbaric appearance similar to those of the first worshippers of Ulric, but in truth they are a highly disciplined and martial Order whose presence inspire both courage and savagery that rivals that of even the most blood-thirsty and savage of the Northmen Warriors.

!!Middenland

Middenland is a vast and darkly forested province. With the city-state of Middenheim, the province is the powerhouse of the northern Empire. However, Middenland’s relationship with its capital, Middenheim, is rather complex. The City of the White Wolf has not always been part of the province—its fortunes often waxing and waning with the ruling houses of the times. In truth, the city and the province are separate political and social entities, drawn together by the rule of Boris Todbringer, and likely to fracture should power pass from his line.

Like all Northerners, Middenlanders are famed for their stubborn ways. This, their Teutogen blood and their “firebrand” tempers has given them a reputation as uncontrollable traditionalists. They hate change of all types, and defend what they see as “tradition” at all cost.

The province is home both to the Knights Panther—the Graf’s royal guard—and the Knights of the White Wolf, templars fiercely devoted to the service of Ulric and the protection of his people. As the latter joined to the team of Middenheim, the Knights Panther decided to join to the team of the province — so the rivalry continues. So much the more as The Knights Panther are headquartered in a stout fortress built in the modern style, just a few miles from Carroburg. To be accepted into this order, a squire must hunt down and kill a great forest cat single-handedly, placing its skin beneath his saddle when knighted.

!!Nordland

The province of Nordland is famous for its navy and its heavily tolled coastal roads which provide safe passage for rich merchants travelling to Marienburg. Many sea fortresses and watchtowers line the coast, as raiders from across the Sea of Claws are all too common.

The people of Nordland are descendents of the ancient Was Jutone tribe. Close brothers to the Was Jutones of Ostland, the Nordland branch of the tribe eventually became estranged from the more easterly settlements of their peoples. Eventually, the early Nordlanders fell in battle, becoming vassals of the belligerent Teutogens, and frequent victims of Norscan raids. During the chaos that reigned in the aftermath of the Great Plague, much of Nordland’s coasts of the river valleys were invaded and colonised by the Norscans, leading to a mingling of the tribal bloodlines. Emperor Mandred Ratslayer, faced with graver threats elsewhere, had little time to answer the pleas of the Nordlanders, much to their horror. As time passed and populations mixed, the Nordlanders adopted many of the customs of their Norscan cousins.

!!Ostland

The province of Ostland is dominated by the Forest of Shadows. The Middle Mountains themselves are the highest point in the Empire and their peaks are inhabitated by a large number of Ogres.

Notoriously thrifty, Ostlanders are known for their ability to survive. At their best, Ostlander are coolheaded in a crisis, practical, and not given to airs and graces. They are proud survivors, and teach their offspring to hold their heads high, despite the circumstances.

Although every Ostlander loves his ale, a few men in every village take this love to extremes. Never sober and rarely conscious these buffoons stagger their way through the streets of Mordheim yelling slurred insults at whomever they meet, committing petty acts of vandalism and generally making a mess of things. This comic behaviour is often misconstrued into a false belief that they are harmless, a belief that many live to regret. Fuelled by vast quantities of booze these are very dangerous, unpredictable men indeed who will shove a broken bottle into your face as soon as laugh heartily and burst into song!

!!Mootland

In the year 1010 the Halflings were granted the area around the Upper Aver river to serve as their homeland. Located in the junction between the rivers of Blue Reach and Aver Reach, the province possesses a rich and highly fertile soil, which always brings in bountiful harvests year after year. For this reason, most of its inhabitants are farmers, and The Moot is one of the main providers of food for The Empire.

The Moot is predominantly inhabited by a race of short humanoids called Halflings. Roughly half the size of a fully grown man, Halflings are a peaceful and rustic folk, more interested in the comforts of home than adventures and warfare.

None know why, but Halflings and Ogres just get on. Most elders of Halfling clans have one or two Ogre bodyguards, and it’s said the Elder of the Moot rarely travels without his old friend Zorarth Legbiter, a hoary Ogre who’s lived in the Empire for almost a century. In return, many Ogre mercenary bands employ Halfling cooks.

!!Ostermark

The rural province of Ostermark is a sombre and grim land with a history abound with battles, invasions, disaster and lawless reavers. To the north lies rugged Kislev, to the south the cursed lands of Sylvania. Other landmarks include the ruined city of Mordheim, the Bleak Moors, and the ancient battlesite of Hel Fenn.

Ostermarkers tend to be stout and thickset, and their eyes often reveal an Eastern heritage brought by the Ungols long ago. Because of the cold weather, Ostermarkers tend to wear several layers of clothing in a style that seems quaint or old-fashioned to others in the Empire. Most claim that Ostermarkers are half Kislevite, half peasant and entirely morose. Famed for long drinking binges, elaborate funerals, and combinations of the two, many people fear to ask an Ostermarker how their day has been, for fear of a depressing monologue.

Ostermark is the home of the Knights of the Everlasting Light, champions of justice and lost causes, but are perhaps even better known for being a cursed order. After a series of disasters, such as fire, earthquake, and comet-strikes, the current chapterhouse is based in the city of Essen in Ostermark. They are known to polish their armour to a highly reflective shine and their primary symbol is that of a lit candle, sometimes modified to feature a forked flame. In battle, they wield enchanted lances that gleam with such luminosity that the foe cannot see to adequately defend themselves against the Templars' devastating charge.

!!Stirland

Stirland is a poor province. Descended from the Asoborn tribe of old, Stirlanders are a short, thickset people, much like their Ostermark neighbours. At their best, Stirlanders are calm, thoughtful, and practised at taking their time about things. At their worst, Stirlanders are isolationist, suspicious, and hidebound. People in the central portion of the province are known for their dislike of Halflings, for they still resent the 1500-year-old decision that tore away their best farmlands and gave them to “the Shorties.”

The Order of the Sacred Scythe have made it their duty to patrol the shadowy roads and paths of Eastern Stirland. Long and mysterious is their history, with most of the Chapterhouse records kept under lock and key. Rumors abound that the Order has tainted bloodlines of ill-repute — but no one knows for sure. What is known about the Scythes is that they are well-versed hunters of the Vampire. They tirelessly root out possible Vampiric threats, cults, and any who would serve such a dark master. As the Scythes deal mainly with creatures of the night and dark magics, their methods are widely considered unorthodox and often downright improper. Most of the neighboring provinces openly despise the Sacred Scythes and do not welcome them in their taverns or towns. This distrust is not entirely unfounded. Such is their fervor to destroy the living dead, that more than one town has been left burnt to the ground and smoldering in the wake of a Sacred Scythe "Tribunal."

!!Sylvania

The land of Sylvania lays in Stirland uner the shadow of the World Edge Mountains. Long ruled by the von Drak family, Sylvania was usurped by infamous Vampire Vlad von Carstein who the attempted to overthrow the Empire during what are now known as the Wars of the Vampire Counts. Since the Battle of Hel Fenn in 2145, Sylvania has been re-absorbed by Stirland, although in truth it is a mostly barren region, rightfully shunned by sane folk.

The people of Sylvania are a dour lot, rarely smiling and not fond of talking to strangers. Doors are kept bolted and people regularly make a sign against the Evil Eye when something unsettling happens. They are also fatalistic, accepting that life has a dismal end in store for them. So resigned to their “destiny” are the Sylvanians that few ever leave the province— much to the relief of their neighbours. Since Sylvania’s population never truly recovered from the horrors of the Black Plague and the contagions that followed, overcrowding had never been a problem in these towns and villages.

In addition to disease, mutation is relatively common amongst the peasant populace. The thin soil has been riddled with Warpstone since the Warpstone meterorite falls of 1111 IC, giving Sylvania one of the highest rates of mutation within the entire Empire. The most deformed Mutants are cast out into the woods or sent to Drakenhof, but many who would be burned elsewhere are accepted in Sylvania.

Despite not being a sovereign province, Sylvania got its own spot in IMHABOC. According to the gossip, the leaders of the WFHB were bribed by the von Carsteins who want to increase their popularity with the help of the league by providing some circus for the people of the Empire.

!!Talabecland

The vast province of Talabecland is heavily forested and sparsely populated. The land is named after Taal, the god of beasts and wild places. Talabecland is perhaps one of the largest of the Imperial provinces, and its dominant features include its dominion over the River Stir and the River Talabec, as well political control over nearly all of the Great Forest. Much of the province's trade flows along these rivers, as well as trade that flows through to the north and south along the Great Forest Road. In Talabecland lies the major fortress-city of Heldenhame Keep, which is situated on several key trade routes. The provincial capital city of Talabecland is Talabheim, a large city-state built inside a titanic meteorite crater miles upon miles wide.

Talabeclanders are more welcoming than their rural Stirland cousins. The role of the father is considered especially important to the folk of the Great Woods. Even town-born men take their sons to the woods of a summer, and teach them how follow a trail, light a fire, and catch a meal. This is considered a matter of practicality, just like a Marienburger learning to swim. And though they do not wear leaves, as others accuse them of doing, Talabeclanders generally eschew elaborate clothes and prefer practical garb that can stand up to rough handling. Talabeclanders are also known for their warlike ways.

Talabecland it the home of many light armored knights who are masters of stealth, and are excellent hunters and trackers. Knights of the Longshanks or the Knights of the Verdant Field are more akin scouts or rangers than typical knights. They are masters of the wilderness, stalking the wild woods and forests like vengeful ghosts, hunting down enemies and trespassers with no mercy.

!!Talabheim

Deep within the Great Forest lies the city-state of Talabheim. A massive crater several miles wide forms the base of a heavily fortified rim wall that encircles the impregnable city.

Talabheim one of the strongest and most fortified city within the Empire, perhaps second-only to the great fortress-city of Middenheim itself. However, this proteciton is bought at a high cost, for the city's civilian populace lives in grim poverty to support Talabheim's demanding military and an unforgiving martial law is in force at all times. Despite this, Talabheim as served as the greatest bastion of light within the dark forest of the Empire.

Talabheim is home to many knightly orders, including the Knights of the Blazing Sun, an order of templars dedicated to Myrmidia, Goddess of Soldiers and Strategy. Gathering as a large force only rarely, they instead travel in small groups or individually, acting as advisors to nobles and their generals on the art of war. Sometimes they command units or whole armies in the field, using their skills and reputation to keep militia troops from breaking and mercenaries loyal. At some point in his career, a Knight of the Blazing Sun will be sent out on his own for one to two years, to test what he has learned and forge his skills in the crucible of combat. Many an isolated village, farmstead, or coaching inn has been saved by a young Knight taking charge of the defence.
