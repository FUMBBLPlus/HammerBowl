!!Barak Varr

Barak Varr is a Karak of the Dwarfs located in the Border Princes. Approaching from the land, it is impossible to tell that it is a busy port. In fact, even when standing on the cliff edge it seems that the ships are destined to smash into the cliff face. However, the fierce tides of the Black Gulf have carved out an enormous cave system, and it is in these caverns that the Dwarfs harbour their trading fleet.

!!Karak Azgal

Karak Azgal was once an extremely wealthy Dwarf Hold that has since fallen under the control of the Greenskins and the Skaven. The Greenskins destroyed and abandoned Karak Azgal in frustration after failing to find Stunty treasure. The Dragon Graug the Terrible soon claimed the hold. For many years, treasure seekers and adventurers came to the crag to challenge the Dragon and loot the ruins. All of them failed until the Dwarf warrior Skalf Dragonslayer entered the ruins. He discovered the hidden vault and confronted Graug. After an epic battle, Skalf slew the Dragon by chopping off his head, claimed the treasures and the kingship of Karak Azgal for himself. The Dwarfs made no attempt to recapture the hold, which is still infested with Goblins, Skaven, and other foul creatures. Instead, Skalf and his descendants established a town, Deadgate, in the valley below the old entrance.

It is now a major destination for adventuring and mercenary bands of the Old World who seek to brave its dangers in the hopes of plundering its still vast riches. The Dwarfs are happy to allow this activity — so long as they can heavily tax any who return to the surface after plundering their former home.

!!Karak Azul

The last of the great southern holds to remain under Dwarf control, Karak Azul, is situated over the richest iron mines in the Worlds Edge Mountains. It has withstood its long history of invasions thanks to the determination and skill of its weaponsmiths and armourers. The keenest blades and the most impenetrable suits of armour come from the anvils of Karak Azul. There, the finest Runesmiths, watched over by Thorek Ironbrow, toil to forge weapons to arm the beleaguered outposts found throughout the Karaz Ankor.

!!Karak Eight Peaks

Karak Eight Peaks was one of the greatest kingdoms ever created by the Dwarfs of the Golden Age, rivaling even the capital city of Karaz-a-Karak in terms of sheer power, wealth, and beauty. As the cataclysmic age known as the Time of Woes has erupted all across the world, the grand halls of Karak Eight Peaks were laid low by coming onslaught of the Greenskin and Skaven race. With their arrival, the city has become an eternal battleground between these three races that would endure until the inevitable destruction of this world.

Recently Belegar Ironhammer and his dwarves have gained a foothold in the city, largely confined to the surface and upper levels of the city, despite being under a near-continuous siege. Slowly they found and sealed off the tunnels the goblins and Skaven had used to breach the city, as well as walling off areas too poisoned by Chaos to be reclaimed.

!!Karak Kadrin

Situated south of Peak Pass, Karak Kadrin (“Stronghold of the Pass”) is the largest of the northern holds after Karaz-a-Karak. In its heyday, the pass connected the strongholds of the west to the mines and settlements of the eastern side of the World's Edge Mountains. Since the fall of the east, Dwarfs no longer use this pass, but it has become one of the main routes for marauding Orcs and Goblins from the Dark Lands. Karak Kadrin, nicknamed “The Slayer Keep” by the Dwarfs, guards the pass against the greenskin invaders.

!!Karak Raziak

Karak-Raziak is a minor dwarven hold serving under the aegis of Karak-Kadrin, located further north. It played an important role during the Wars of the Vampire Counts, in which its rulers, along with others from other holds, sent warriors to aid the Empire as it battled Konrad von Carstein's undead hordes.

!!Karaz-a-Karak

The mightiest and most populous of all Dwarf cities, and it remains the capital of the Karaz Ankor and is the stronghold of the High King. Here, amongst its ancient temples to the Ancestor Gods, High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer holds court in a vaulted Great Hall large enough to engulf a human town.
